# TukTrack 🚖

**TukTrack** is a mobile app designed to help **tuk-tuk (auto rickshaw) owners** — especially in **Madagascar** — easily manage their independent drivers, track daily deposits, monitor maintenance schedules, and oversee overall revenue and expenses.

Each tuk-tuk typically has **two drivers** (day and night shifts). After their shift, drivers make a **fixed deposit** to the owner. TukTrack allows owners to **track these deposits**, **manage maintenance**, and **keep a simple financial overview** of their fleet.
